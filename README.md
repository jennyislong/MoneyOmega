Project Statement

Personal money management and financial literacy are very important for everyone. Currently, there are many youth and individuals that have trouble managing their finances or do not know much about the topic. There should be an easily usable and reliable web application that not only aids users in budgeting their money but also teaches them. Users should be able to set up a unique profile to input and set up a budget plan, receive reminders to make payments, extra tools to aid payment and learn more about financial literacy.
